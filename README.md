## Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
<br>
The app I developed is a simple inventory app specifically used for warehouses to track items. The goals include having at least two tables to store inventory items and store user logins and passwords. The display of inventory items need to be in a grid and the user should have the ability to add/remove items, increase/decrease specific items in the inventory, and to notify the user when the amount of any items in the inventory has been reduced to zero.

## What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
<br>
I created multiple screens, main screens include the login and main database grid containing all items that would be in the database. Additional screens include separate windows for adding, or editing items. Keeping windows designated to proper functionality was useful to keep everything organized and contained, ensuring the focus on each purpose and operation that would be committed.

## How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
<br>
I first designed the wireframes by making a drawing prototype and then replicating it on Android Studio. Taking into consideration of user needs and usability, when designing the screens. After the basic components such as buttons or text were implemented, I moved to the main Java files and started with the login then slowly developed into the inventory screens and databases. I think doing this linear technique helped with organization and keeping to focusing on one section at a time to prevent confusion when dealing with multiple files when coding.

## How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
<br>
Constantly testing my app, I would ensure that there were no initial errors before testing and acting as a 'potential user' to understand what and how they can experience when using the app. I had to test the login system and database multiple times and the process of switching from screen to screen impacted my design as I would have to add more navigation buttons to ensure users can go back to the main page (which was something I forgot to account for).

## Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
<br>
The biggest challenge I overcame was the process of creating multiple databases and creating functionality such as CRUD to help me with retrieving and displaying queries. It was the main subject for the project so I wanted to make sure that I could accomplish this feature. I initially had a hard time differentiating between different files so I had to keep my coding organized such as naming conventions in both the front-end and back-end.

## In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
<br>
I was most proud of the transitioning of my activities and the creation and functionality of my databases of relaying input data into the system and transitioning that given data to the proper functionality. For example, the login system needed branching between a registered user and an existing user. In addition to that, ensuring that the needed input data was all filled in before continuing to process that data. Making sure that the username and password forms were filled and to notify the user when requirements were not met.
